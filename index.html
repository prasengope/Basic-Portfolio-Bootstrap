              I was one of the few people that I know of, was against the institution of marriage or family. I always thought a free man should never have a family. I considered family a weakness. Working to provide for few other people was, to me, another form of emotional slavery. You will have to keep doing as long as you can. Thought marriage was a mistake.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then on one fine British summer day, I met someone online on this side of the Atlantic. Couple months later, I, who thought marriage was a weakness, got married on a rainy day. Two souls started, what people call a 'family'.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then on another hot summer day in New York, I became a father! I was even skeptical if I could be a loving father to him. And after spending two and a half years with my son and close to seven years with my wife, I think the fulfillment that family brings far outweighs any other thing.
